To use the library:
1. import the calc_area function from the shapes_area.src.calc_area module.
2. pass to the function as arguments the name of the shape whose area will be calculated, as well as the parameters of this shape according to the description of the function.

To add a new shape:
1. Create a class for this shape by inheriting and initializing the BaseShape.
2. Implement the calculate_area function to be able to calculate the area. 
3. Add the name of the shape and its corresponding class as the key and value, respectively, to the SHAPES constant.
Perfect! Area of this shape can be calculated using this library.
